        <h2>1 - Full List of Ads</h2>
        <p>A full list of the ads, including all object data (AdId, Brand Id and Name, NumPages, and Position). NumPages refers to how many pages the ad takes up in a magazine (0.5 would be a half-page ad) and Position is a string that is either “Page” or “Cover,” describing where in the magazine the ad ran. This list should be sortable and paged. You may use client-side or server- side code to accomplish this. Default sort should be by brand name alphabetically.</p>

        <h2>2 - Cover Ads with at Least 50% Coverage</h2>
        <p>A list of ads which appeared in the “Cover” position and also had at least 50% page coverage. This list should also be sortable and paged, and sorted by brand name alphabetically.</p>
